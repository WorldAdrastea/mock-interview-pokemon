## Q & A
### Which parts are you most proud of? Why?

The recent searches feature is something I'm most proud of because I have never tried to make a feature like this before and I believe it came out working exactly as I planned from the start. At the start I believed it was overwhelming to conceptualize the functionality of it but as I worked through I'm glad that I was able to break it down and design it in the way I initially intended.

### Where did you spend more time? What was the most difficult?

I spent the most time between the recent searches feature and writing the tests for the application. I believe these were the most difficult for me simply because I spent the most time working on them, which is due to a lack of previous experience with them.


### How did you find the test overall? Did you have issues or difficulties completing?

Whilst I started off with a bit of imposter syndrome, I quickly realized that I could break it down and work through each part of the project, step by step. I believe I have achieved all the aspects of the task at hand with good proficiency and I found it very simple in the end. I had a few issues here and there whilst completing the task but it didn't take too long for me to figure out the problems and solve them.
